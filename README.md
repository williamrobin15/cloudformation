## Description

A testing / example project for AWS CloudFormation templates. It includes sample templates that illustrate how to use:

* Nested Stacks
* ChangeSets
* EC2 resource provisioning

It seems aimed at helping users explore and learn how to structure CloudFormation templates using nested stacks and change sets, possibly for more modular or maintainable infrastructure setups.
